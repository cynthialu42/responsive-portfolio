            <p class="about-me">
                I am a student at Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp in the Winter 2018 cohort.
                I graduated from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor with a BSE in Electrical Engineering, and worked in healthcare IT for the time before attending these classes.
                As I am browsing lorem ipsum generators, I am dissappointed in the lack of bird-themed generators. That is something that must change.
                But, for the time being, here is an interesting cat generator.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me">
                Hit you unexpectedly mrow so woops poop hanging from butt must get rid run run around house drag poop on floor maybe it comes off woops left brown marks on floor human 
                slave clean lick butt now but stare at guinea pigs or you call this cat food, so all of a sudden cat goes crazy, and steal the warm chair right after you get up. 
                Twitch tail in permanent irritation make muffins, yet nap all day, for demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away if it fits, 
                i sits curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. The door is opening! how exciting oh, it's you, meh put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed yet 
                kitty scratches couch bad kitty intently stare at the same spot. Small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur. Chew foot lies down yet ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? 
                lemme use that as my litter box if it fits, i sits curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels for suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage toy mouse squeak roll over. 
                Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr sit by the fire yet sleep in the bathroom sink but step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle paw at beetle 
                and eat it before it gets away. Ears back wide eyed run in circles, but Gate keepers of hell. Annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good 
                i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box when in doubt, wash why must they do that, and ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to 
                go outside and ask to come inside for eat half my food and ask for more for refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Kitty poochy sit on human.
